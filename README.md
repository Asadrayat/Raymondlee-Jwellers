## Project Overview

This repository contains the source code for **Raymond Lee Jewelers** — a high-end jewelry e-commerce website built entirely with custom code on the Shopify platform.

- **No Impulse, Dawn, Prestige, or any other theme** was used as a starting point.
- All templates, sections, snippets, layouts, and assets were hand-coded.
- Focus: clean code structure, performance, accessibility, and luxury brand presentation.
